# OrviboJavaLib
A java library used to discover Orvibo S20 WiFi sockets on a local network.
The ultimate goal is to allow developers a quick way to toggle the power state on the wifi socket programatically.  Most of the existing solutions do not work well, require other libraries like Python or are difficult to follow when reviewing their function.

Some of the concepts of this library were shamelessly stolen from:
